## Overview

### Problem Statement
*What problem does this feature solve? What user pain point are we addressing?*

Example: "Users frequently ask in chat 'who's playing who this week?' and have to manually check Sleeper app"

### Solution Summary
*Brief description of the proposed solution*

Example: "Add a `/weekly-matchups` command that displays current week's fantasy matchups with team records and projections"

### User Story
As a **[user type]**, I want **[functionality]** so that **[benefit]**.

Example: "As a league member, I want to see weekly matchups in Discord so that I can quickly check who's playing without leaving the conversation"

### Success Criteria
*How will we know this feature is successful?*
- [ ] Success metric 1 (e.g., "Command responds within 2 seconds")
- [ ] Success metric 2 (e.g., "Used by at least 5 different users in first week")
- [ ] Success metric 3 (e.g., "Reduces 'who's playing who?' questions in chat")

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
*What the feature must do*
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2  
- [ ] Requirement 3

Example:
- [ ] Display all matchups for specified week
- [ ] Show team names and current records
- [ ] Handle both current and historical weeks
- [ ] Default to current week if no week specified

### Non-Functional Requirements
*Performance, security, usability requirements*
- [ ] Response time under 2 seconds
- [ ] Handle invalid input gracefully
- [ ] Mobile-friendly Discord formatting
- [ ] Support for all league sizes (8-14 teams)

### Out of Scope
*What this feature explicitly will NOT do*
- Live score updates (separate feature)
- Detailed player projections (too complex for Discord)
- Historical matchup analysis (future enhancement)

## Discord Command Specification

### Command Syntax
```
/command-name [required-parameter] [optional-parameter]
```

### Parameters
- `required-parameter` (required): Description of what this parameter does
- `optional-parameter` (optional, default: value): Description with default behavior

### Usage Examples
```
/weekly-matchups
/weekly-matchups week:5
/weekly-matchups week:12 year:2023
```

### Expected Response Format
*Mock up what the Discord response should look like*

```
üìÖ **Week 5 Matchups**

üèà **Team A** (8-2) vs **Team B** (6-4)
   ‚îî Projected: 125.4 - 118.2

üèà **Team C** (7-3) vs **Team D** (5-5)  
   ‚îî Projected: 132.1 - 127.8

üèà **Team E** (9-1) vs **Team F** (4-6)
   ‚îî Projected: 140.5 - 115.3
```

### Error Handling
*What happens when things go wrong*
- Invalid week number ‚Üí "Week must be between 1 and 18"
- No matchups found ‚Üí "No matchups found for Week X"
- Sleeper API unavailable ‚Üí "Unable to fetch matchups right now, try again later"
- User not linked ‚Üí "Please link your Sleeper account first using the onboarding flow"

---

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decision
*How does this fit into existing code structure?*

**Pattern**: Follow existing command pattern (handler ‚Üí interactor ‚Üí external API)
**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `internal/discord/weekly_matchups.go` - New command handler
- `internal/discord/handler.go` - Register command in `registerCommands()`
- `internal/interactor/matchups.go` - Business logic (create if doesn't exist)
- Tests for all new code

### Database Changes
*Any database schema or query changes needed?*

**Required**: None - uses existing Sleeper API data
**Optional**: Could cache matchup data for performance
**Future**: Add user preferences for default week display

### External Dependencies
*New APIs, libraries, or services needed*

**Existing**: Sleeper API (already integrated)
**New**: None required
**Considerations**: Rate limiting on Sleeper API (already handled)

### Code Structure Overview
```go
// Handler (internal/discord/weekly_matchups.go)
func (h *Handler) handleWeeklyMatchupsCommand(ctx context.Context, s *discordgo.Session, i *discordgo.InteractionCreate) {
    // Extract parameters from Discord interaction
    // Call interactor for business logic
    // Format and send response
}

// Interactor (internal/interactor/matchups.go) 
func (i *interactor) GetWeeklyMatchups(ctx context.Context, week, year int) (*domain.WeeklyMatchups, error) {
    // Validate inputs
    // Fetch data from Sleeper API
    // Transform into domain objects
    // Return structured data
}

// Domain type (pkg/types/domain/matchup.go)
type WeeklyMatchups struct {
    Week      int
    Year      int
    Matchups  []Matchup
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
*What units of code need testing?*
- [ ] Handler parameter extraction and validation
- [ ] Interactor business logic with various inputs
- [ ] Error handling for all failure scenarios
- [ ] Discord response formatting

### Integration Tests
*End-to-end testing scenarios*
- [ ] Full command flow with valid week number
- [ ] Invalid input handling
- [ ] Sleeper API integration
- [ ] Database integration (if applicable)

### Manual Testing Checklist
*Test cases to verify manually*
- [ ] Command works in Discord development server
- [ ] Response formatting looks good on mobile
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (< 2 seconds)

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- [ ] Create basic command handler
- [ ] Implement interactor business logic
- [ ] Add command registration
- [ ] Basic testing

### Phase 2: Polish & Error Handling
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Response formatting improvements
- [ ] Edge case testing
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Full test coverage
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Manual testing in Discord
- [ ] Code review

### Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1**: [X hours]
- **Phase 2**: [Y hours] 
- **Phase 3**: [Z hours]
- **Total**: [Total hours]

---

## Future Enhancements
*Ideas for extending this feature later*

- Add projections and fantasy points
- Include injury status for key players
- Add reaction-based interaction (üëç for predictions)
- Integration with `/predictions` command
- Weekly matchup reminders/notifications

---

## Notes & Decisions

### Design Decisions
*Important decisions made during development*

**Decision**: Use existing Discord command pattern
**Reasoning**: Consistency with other commands, proven approach

**Decision**: Default to current week
**Reasoning**: Most common use case, reduces typing

### Technical Notes
*Implementation details for future reference*

- Sleeper API returns matchups as individual team entries, need to group by matchup_id
- Handle bye weeks (some teams may not have matchups)
- Consider caching for performance if API calls become expensive

### AI Agent Context
*Quick context for AI development sessions*

**Goal**: Add `/weekly-matchups` command that shows fantasy football matchups for any week
**Pattern**: Follow existing command structure in `internal/discord/` and `internal/interactor/`
**Key Files**: Look at `/career-stats` command for implementation pattern reference
**Testing**: Use table-driven tests following existing patterns in `*_test.go` files

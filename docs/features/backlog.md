## Ideas & Future Exploration
*Concepts that need more research or are longer-term possibilities*

### AI Integration
- **Concept**: Integrate with OpenAI/Claude for natural language fantasy analysis
- **Research Needed**: Cost analysis, API integration approach
- **Potential Value**: Users could ask "should I start Player X?" and get AI analysis
- **Complexity**: High - needs careful cost management and rate limiting

### Advanced Analytics Dashboard

- **Research Needed**: Frontend framework choice, hosting requirements
- **Potential Value**: Deep insights beyond what fits in Discord
- **Complexity**: Very High - essentially a new application

### League History Visualization
- **Concept**: Generate charts/graphs of league performance over time
- **Research Needed**: Chart generation libraries, image hosting
- **Potential Value**: End-of-season summaries, historical comparisons
- **Complexity**: Medium - mostly about data visualization

## Feature Evaluation Criteria

When prioritizing features, consider:

### User Value
- **High**: Solves a frequent user pain point or request
- **Medium**: Enhances existing workflows
- **Low**: Nice to have but not commonly requested

### Implementation Effort
- **Small**: 1-4 hours, minimal new code
- **Medium**: 4-16 hours, new command/feature
- **Large**: 16+ hours, significant new functionality

### Technical Risk
- **Low**: Uses existing patterns and APIs
- **Medium**: Requires new dependencies or approaches
- **High**: Significant unknowns or external dependencies

### Maintenance Burden
- **Low**: Self-contained, unlikely to break
- **Medium**: Moderate ongoing maintenance
- **High**: Complex features requiring regular updates

## Notes for AI Agents

**Quick Context**: This backlog represents the current feature priorities for the Any Given Sunday Discord Bot. Features in "High Priority" should be tackled first.

**Development Flow**: 
1. Move feature from backlog to `docs/features/in-progress/`
2. Create detailed feature document using template
3. Implement following existing code patterns
4. Move to `docs/features/completed/` when done

**Key Patterns**: All Discord commands follow the handler → interactor → database pattern. See existing commands like `/career-stats` for reference implementation.
